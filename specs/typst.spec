Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use.
Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong
